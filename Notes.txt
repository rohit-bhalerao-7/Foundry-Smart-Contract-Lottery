Notes from Smart Contract Lottery:

Smart Contract isn't written in one go, write a component test it debug it
Use the CEI design pattern: Checks, Effects, Interactions

We use helper config to easily deploy on blockchain without worrying on how to deploy on that specific blockchain
For eg: in Raffle.sol the constructor's parameters depends on which blockchain it is deployed
